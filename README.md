# Design Wiki

[The Design Wiki](https://github.com/18F/Design-Wiki/wiki) is a shared repository of sample design artifacts that have been produced at 18F (such as content audits, moodboards, wireframes, and style guides). The wiki is a “living” repository; it will continue to expand and change as people make contributions. 

##How to contribute

There are two ways to contribute:

- If you are an 18F employee who feels comfortable making the update yourself (and you have the time), then you can clone the wiki locally and commit your changes directly to `master`. When making your contribution, please follow the instructions outlined in the *guidelines for contributing* (see below).

- If you are not an 18F employee, or if you would prefer not to make the change yourself, then you can log an issue in this GitHub repo, and we will work with you to add your content to the wiki. The first step in the process will be for you to collect all the information that is outlined in the *guidelines for contributing* (see below), so please read that section before logging your issue.

###Guidelines for contributing

First, when you assemble your contribution, please remember that this wiki is public, and that we need to **be careful about accidentally sharing sensitive information.** Check out [this section of 18F’s open source policy](https://github.com/18F/open-source-policy/blob/master/practice.md#protecting-sensitive-information) for some guidance.

Next, you will need to assemble your materials. The following items are required for a contribution:

1. **Type of artifact.** What kind of artifact is it (e.g., a mood board, a content guide, a prototype)? Decide what type of artifact it is and whether or not there is already a page for it on the wiki. If there is already a page, then your contribution can be added to that page. If there is not yet a page, then a new page will need to be created. 

2. **Screenshot.** All of the examples included on the wiki have a screenshot associated with them, to help users determine which examples will be most relevant to them. Here are some guidelines for creating screenshots:
    - When you provide a screenshot, save it as .png file. 
    - If the screenshot mostly contains text, put a border on the image so that users can easily distinguish the text in the screenshot from the rest of the text on the wiki page. 
    - If you are updating the wiki directly, note that your images will need to be stored in the `img` folder.
    - Finally, remember to avoid revealing sensitive information through screenshots.

3. **Link to file.** Provide a link to the relevant file. Again, it is important not to reveal sensitive information to the public, so be sure the file is stored somewhere with the appropriate security permissions. If your file is restricted from public access, then you will need to denote that by putting a :lock: icon next to the link.   

4. **Project name.** What is the name of the project for which this artifact was produced? Please let us know. Also, if the project is finished and accessible online, then we would love to share a link to it, if you can provide one.

5. **Project contributors.** Who contributed to this project? Please provide a list of names.

6. **Context description.** What additional background information can you provide about this artifact, or the reason for creating it? A context description can be helpful for users to understand how the example you’re providing is potentially relevant (or irrelevant) for their own work.
