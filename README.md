# Design Wiki

[The Design Wiki](https://github.com/18F/Design-Wiki/wiki) is a shared repository of sample design artifacts that have been produced at 18F (such as content audits, moodboards, wireframes, and style guides). The wiki is a “living” repository; it will continue to expand and change as people make contributions. 

## Contributing to this wiki

We are working to design a smooth process for contributing to the wiki. In the meantime, if you would like to contribute, please feel free to log a GitHub issue about your contribution, and we will work with you to get your content added to the site. Alternatively, if you are an 18F employee, you can contact Emmanuel (Mannie) Pressley, or you can ping the #design-wiki channel in Slack.
